# Art direction
Game will be heavily inspired by aesthetics (and gameplay) of Dishonored franchise with more emphasis on the atmosphere and dark aesthetics which should push players’ perception of the dark and unforgiving world they are in. Thematically speaking, the game is also inspired by The Witcher series, Slavic folklore and medieval Europe aesthetics.

Visuals are going to be done in 3D with stylised graphics using painterly looks (and textures) and heavy use of 2D VFX and supporting assets. Graphics fidelity is not the main focus instead we shall focus heavily on the strong art direction and heavy atmosphere.

## Graphics fidelity
Meshes with low to mid poly count with heavy utilisation of textures to „paint in“ missing details imitating painterly looks. Animation is going to be „hand animated“. Using „motion capture“ technology is to be considered depending on capabilities, resources and time constrains.

Models are going to be made, rigged and animated using industry standard software (Blender, Maya,…) and textured using Adobe Substance Painter. Texture size will heavily depend on size/scale of assets while accounting for optimisation for low-end hardware capabilities. Textures and models will be heavily lifted by lighting and overall design of the models.

# Core gameplay loop
Whole gameplay concept consists of 3 parts for each section. Cutscene at the beginning of the chapter with a storytelling purpose followed by gameplay section. After getting through the gameplay section player will witness another story telling cutscene before loading into a new level. Cutscenes are overall used as a bridge in between gameplay sections but can also occur during gameplay.

## Gameplay loop overview

Player spawns (starts) at the beginning of the level and has to get through the level using tools at the players’ disposal while fighting off enemies in the level and/or by interacting with neutral or friendly NPCs (non-playable characters) while exploring semi linear levels.Player get’s rewarded for his actions by either getting/finding resources or unlocking new spells and powers.

### Example of gameplay

- After player starts, their initial assignment should be to look around and try figuring out the best way to approach the level (searching for paths, materials/resources, NPCs and mapping positions of enemies). 
- After resource and intel gathering, player is going to use all of the intel and resources gathered to get through the semi linear level while trying to stay alive and either kill as many enemies as possible or avoid every hostile NPC to get through the level peacefully. 
- Trough out the level player will find and unlock new ways to play and also gather resources which can be used either to complete the level or saved for the upcoming level.

### Fighting system

Player will use their sword, assets and spells to kill their enemies. One of the mechanics is going to be a simple parry system, chain/combo attacks and rage/madness meter. For the player this means that aggressive and fast gameplay is the best and most efficient way to play trough the level. Fast and deadly = better.  
Although the game offers player an option to avoid fighting and enemies, this is not the main focus and will be given less time an resources because of the time restrains of the project.

## Level design overview
Players will be put into two general types of rooms, Arenas and Corridors. Arenas have focus on clearing out the enemies inside the Arena.

# Story

This story is a dark fantasy tragedy exploring the cyclical nature of violence and the loss of self in the obsessive pursuit of vengeance.

## Act I: The Calm Before the Storm

The main character, a Monster Hunter, lives a quiet life with his wife in a cozy hut on the edge of a town steeped in paranoia. The local lands are suffering from blight and illness, and the local Lord, a pious fanatic, uses the people's fear to his advantage. In his sermons, he preaches of a "great cleansing" needed to purge the "unseen corruption" plaguing their homes. The Lord secretly desires the Hunter's wife, viewing her as a symbol of purity he must possess. To get the Hunter out of the way, he sends him on increasingly perilous missions.

The story begins as the Hunter receives a new quest: to slay a fearsome beast terrorizing the countryside. While he prepares, his wife, who is knowledgeable in his craft, helps him mix alchemical oils. She is anxious, not only about the danger of the beast but about the Lord's increasingly venomous rhetoric. "Be careful," she warns. "His words are turning neighbors against each other."

During the hunt, the Hunter finds an unsettling, spiral-like symbol carved into the stone near the beast's lair. The monster itself feels unnaturally twisted, a product of pure malice rather than nature. After a grueling fight, he slays it. In its dying moments, he hears a faint, mocking whisper in his mind. Shaking it off as exhaustion, he returns home.

## Act II: Ash and Betrayal

Upon his return, he finds his home ransacked. In the distance, he hears the roar of a crowd from the town square and runs towards the sound. He arrives to a horrifying scene: a huge mob is screaming, "Burn the witch!" and on a pyre in the center stands his wife.
The Lord points at her, his voice ringing with false righteousness. "This woman is tainted! Her husband consorts with the darkness of the wilds and has brought its corruption into our midst! We shall purify this town with fire!"

Blinded by grief and rage, the Hunter fights his way through the crowd, only to be stopped by the town guard. The Lord proclaims him an enemy and a heretic. He defends himself fiercely, but is overwhelmed by their numbers. Struck down and defeated, he is dragged towards the dungeons. His last conscious sight is of the flames engulfing his wife as the Lord watches with a triumphant, fanatical gaze.

## Act III: The Pact and the Metamorphosis

The Hunter awakens in a cold cell. The Lord visits to mock him, not out of simple cruelty, but with the conviction of a zealot. "Your corruption has been cleansed," he sneers. "You will face the pyre next."
After nights of torment, a Shadowy Figure manifests in his cell. It is an ancient, formless entity, and on the wall behind it, the same spiral symbol from the forest briefly glows. The Figure offers him the power to exact his revenge for a price to be paid later. Having lost everything, the Hunter agrees.

As dark power floods him, he feels a profound emptiness. The intricate knowledge of a hunter—tracking, alchemy, traps—is wiped clean, replaced by a singular, brutal instinct. The screams of his transformation attract the guards. He breaks his chains not with skill, but with raw force. When the guards open the door, he lunges from the shadows, now a demonic caricature of his former self, and massacres them with unnatural speed and strength. He feels a spike of power from their deaths—an addictive, fleeting sensation. He escapes the prison, no longer a calculating hunter, but a creature of pure instinct and rage.

## Act IV: The Hunter Becomes the Hunted

His path to the Lord's castle is a trail of slaughter that physically corrupts the world around him.
In the town's outskirts, his violence attracts beast-like ghouls that crawl from the gutters. The few remaining citizens scream "Murderer!"

As he carves his way to the city center, the landscape itself begins to twist and decay. Demons now walk the streets, some ignoring him as one of their own. People now flee from him shrieking "Monster!" His memories of his wife begin to fade and distort into nightmarish visions.

He finally reaches the castle, a surreal fortress warped by the demonic energy he has unleashed. He cuts down the last of the Lord's elite guard and confronts him in the throne room. The Lord is not hiding; he is waiting, holding a holy relic that slightly dampens the Hunter's new powers.

"Look at the ruin you have wrought," the Lord says with unnerving calm. "You have proven me right. The Hunter of Monsters is now a monster himself." The Lord attempts a sneak attack, but the Hunter is far faster. He deflects the blow and cuts the Lord down in a merciless flurry.
His revenge is complete. But as the Lord's body falls, the Hunter feels nothing but emptiness. The demons in the room do not attack; they simply watch. The Shadowy Figure descends from the ceiling to claim its prize. "Your rage has sown a beautiful harvest," its voice echoes in his mind.

The Hunter tries to resist, but he is powerless. With a single, agonizing touch, the Figure reaches into his chest and rips out his soul. The Hunter is no more, only an empty vessel, a mindless shadow servant bound to the very entity that orchestrated his fall. His revenge is complete, and the cost was everything.
